## Day 1: Install TypeScript

**Project Requirements:**
- Install TypeScript globally on your system using npm or yarn.
- Verify the installation by checking the TypeScript version using `tsc -v`.

## Day 2: Basic TypeScript Syntax

**Project Requirements:**

- Write a simple TypeScript program that prints "Hello, TypeScript!" to the console.

## Day 3: Type Annotations

**Project Requirements:**
- Learn how to use type annotations to explicitly define variable types.
- Create variables with different data types (string, number, boolean, etc.) and annotate their types.

## Day 4: Type Inference

**Project Requirements:**
- Explore TypeScript's type inference system.
- Declare variables without explicit type annotations and observe how TypeScript infers types.

## Day 5: Functions in TypeScript

**Project Requirements:**
- Define functions with parameter type annotations and return type annotations.
- Write functions that accept different types of parameters and return values.

## Day 6: Interfaces

**Project Requirements:**
- Understand the concept of interfaces in TypeScript.
- Create interfaces to define the structure of objects or classes.
- Implement interfaces in functions and classes.

## Day 7: Classes and Inheritance

**Project Requirements:**
- Learn how to create classes in TypeScript.
- Implement inheritance using classes and extend base classes.
- Explore constructors and access modifiers (public, private, protected).

## Day 8: Generics

**Project Requirements:**
- Dive into TypeScript generics for creating reusable code with type safety.
- Write generic functions and classes that work with different data types.

## Day 9: Enums

**Project Requirements:**
- Explore TypeScript enums for defining a set of named constants.
- Create enums for representing categories, status, or options in your code.

## Day 10: Modules and Namespaces

**Project Requirements:**
- Understand modules and namespaces in TypeScript.
- Organize your code into separate modules and export/import them.
- Create a simple application with multiple modules.

## Day 11: Advanced TypeScript Features

**Project Requirements:**
- Learn about advanced TypeScript features like decorators, type guards, and conditional types.
- Experiment with these features in your codebase.

## Day 12: TypeScript with JavaScript Libraries

**Project Requirements:**
- Integrate TypeScript with popular JavaScript libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
- Set up TypeScript configurations for these projects.

## Day 13: Error Handling

**Project Requirements:**
- Implement error handling in TypeScript using try-catch blocks and custom error classes.
- Handle common error scenarios in your application.

## Day 14: Asynchronous Programming

**Project Requirements:**
- Explore asynchronous programming in TypeScript using Promises and async/await.
- Write asynchronous functions that fetch data from APIs.

## Day 15: Type Definitions and Declarations

**Project Requirements:**
- Learn how to use type definitions and declarations for third-party JavaScript libraries (e.g., DefinitelyTyped, @types).
- Add type definitions to your project.

## Day 16: Testing TypeScript Code

**Project Requirements:**
- Set up a testing environment for TypeScript projects (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
- Write test cases for your TypeScript functions and classes.

## Day 17: Debugging TypeScript

**Project Requirements:**
- Practice debugging TypeScript code using integrated development environment (IDE) tools.
- Use breakpoints and debugging tools to identify and fix issues.

## Day 18: Linting and Code Quality

**Project Requirements:**
- Configure a linter (e.g., ESLint, TSLint) for your TypeScript project.
- Follow best practices for code formatting and quality.

## Day 19: Build and Deployment

**Project Requirements:**
- Set up a build system (e.g., Webpack, Rollup) for compiling TypeScript code for production.
- Deploy a TypeScript project to a hosting platform or server.

## Day 20: Portfolio Showcase

**Project Requirements:**
- Create a portfolio showcasing your best TypeScript projects.
- Include project descriptions, code snippets, and live demos.
- Share your portfolio with potential clients or employers.
